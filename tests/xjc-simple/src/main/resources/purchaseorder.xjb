		* JPA section 2.1, entities must be top-level classes.
		* JPA section 2.1, entities must implement the serializable interface.
		* When processing a Microsoft WCF service WSDL, it is recommended that the
		  generateElementProperty customization be set to 'false' in globalBindings.
		* Hint: Increase EnumMemberSizeCap above 256 with typesafeEnumMaxMembers="512".
		* Note: Content Representation, a complex type definition is bound to either a
				Java value class or a content interface, depending on the value of the
				global binding customization generateValueClass (default is "true").

			When "xjc:simple" is enabled, XJC produces Java source code that are more concise and easier to use. Improvements include:
			1) Some content model definitions, such as A,B,A, which used to cause an XJC compilation error and required manual intervention,
			   now compile out of the box without any customization.
			2) Some content model definitions that used to bind to a non-intuitive Java class now binds to a much better Java class.
			3) When repeatable elements are bound, the method name will become plural.
			This feature may only be used when the JAXB XJC binding compiler is run in the -extension mode.
            This extension is defined in the "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb/xjc" namespace.
			See https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/doc/user-guide/ch05.html
