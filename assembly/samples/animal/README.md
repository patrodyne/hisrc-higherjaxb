# Sample: Animal

This is a Maven project to demonstrate the unmarshalling of XML files using an XML Schema to generate the JAXB classes.

## Execution

This is a stand-alone Maven project. You can run the test using:

~~~
mvn clean test
~~~

### Problem

Use the *HiSrc HigherJAXB Maven Plugin* to generate JAXB classes from an XML Schema.

### Solution

Create a Maven project named **Animal** using the standard file layout. This project includes:

+ An XML Schema file (xsd) for the `Animal` model
+ A JAXB *binding* file (xjb) for customizations
+ A JUnit test class to demonstrate (un)marshalling
+ Sample XML files with `Animal` data.
+ The Maven POM file with `hisrc-higherjaxb-maven-plugin`

Animal
    src
        main
            java
            resources
                animal.xjb
                animal.xsd
        test
            java
                org/example/animal/AnimalTest.java
            resources
                simplelogger.properties
            samples
                Animal101.xml
                Animal102.xml
    pom.xml
~~~

The JAXB classes are generated by this plugin 

~~~
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.patrodyne.jvnet</groupId>
    <artifactId>hisrc-higherjaxb-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${hisrc-higherjaxb-maven-plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
~~~

and are generated to:

~~~
target/generated-sources/xjc/
    org.example.animal
        Animal.java
        Species.java
        ObjectFactory.java
~~~

The JUnit test class, `AnimalTest`, scans for the sample files and invokes the method `checkSample(File sample)` to provide each file to the tester. For this project, the file
is a `JAXBContext` is created and each file is unmarshalled to an `animal` object. When successful, the `animal` object is marshalled for logging and your review.
